My name is Marvin Baumgart and I am a programming/design student.

### More Information

I am currently doing my minor in Mobile Media Programming in Chicago, Illinois. In my home institution, which is
in Enschede, Netherlands I am doing Creative Technology. This study program is quite new and has been established in
2010.
For fun I teamed up with a friend and designed a game for Android. I am currently working on a webpage to go with it. That's why 
I am really interested in the class Emergent Web Technologies, because it covers a lot of features I would like to include
in our webpage. Feel free to visit the current webpage [mandtgames.com](http://www.mandtgames.com)
