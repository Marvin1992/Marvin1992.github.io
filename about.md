My name is Marvin Baumgart and I am a programming/design student.

### More Information

I am currently doing my minor in Mobile Media Programming in Chicago, Illinois. I am also finishing up my Bachelor in Creative Technology in the Netherlands beginning of 2016. <br><br>
I am interested in making Apps and BigData. I created an App called Herbert The Pelican with one of my friends a while ago in C#. <br>
I am focusing on JavaScript applications right now, because I think this is where the future is heading. I am targeting specifically hybrid Apps. <br>
