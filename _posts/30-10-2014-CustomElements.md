## Custom Elements

<p>
With custom elements, a method to define one's own elements, own behavior and properties, 
the way web pages and specifically web application are designed will completely be renewed. 
With hiding techniques like Shadow DOM to ensure that one's internal code is encapsulated within a template (<template>), 
one could easily reuse an application function for instance on multiple web pages of his own without having to worry that somebody copies it.

<p>
But the strongest point of custom elements will be the ability to share one's custom elements. 
This sharing progress will be enabled by using the HTML imports, which will make it possible for other people do 
imports other people's items, documents or functionalities from other apps. So basically as soon as the whole concept 
is fully integrated into all web browsers, designing applications or web pages will be revolutionized. Just imagine how 
many people write different java script functions for their applications every day and how easy it will be to use any of
these custom functions within your own code by simple importing somebody's custom element. It is going to be an exciting event!
