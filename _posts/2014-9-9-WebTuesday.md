## The reason why I have chosen this course:

<p>
I took the course Emergent Web Technologies for a specific reason.
Since I am an exchange student I do not have to worry that much about which courses I need to take over here, which is actually quite awesome, because it gives me the freedom to choose any course without having to worry about whether the course is mandatory or not. There is not a single course in my minor I have to take. Of course there are restrictions like choosing courses that are on an equivalent level to the courses I had to take in my home institution, but besides that I can choose what interests me the most from the course catalogue.
The reason why I picked Emergent Web Technologies is on the one hand that I just recently published with a friend of mine my own App and that I want to design a professional webpage to go with it. On the other hand I want to be able to design dynamic 
and screen optimized webpages for different devices helping me to create mobile webpages.

As you can see I am quite interested in anything that has to do with Apps. This interest grew while studying Creative 
Technology in my home institution in Enschede, Netherlands.
Additionally, taking a course that wraps around new emergent technologies is always helpful in this fast globalizing world.
Especially, if you consider the speed at which the internet evolves, the course comes in handy.
To give some idea of what kind of design I find professional I will include some inspirational webpages:

### Web Designs I find inspiring:

1. [D3](http://d3js.org/) - I just love the design of this web page for some reason. It seems very organized and clean, but still stylish to me. And it uses the principle: Less is sometimes more.

2. [Android](http://developer.android.com/index.html) - Of course had to include this web page, because I wanted to get started on it, but never had the time. Definitely, is on the to-do list.

3. [Unity](http://unity3d.com/) - Since I also worked with Unity and since our App has been made with Unity, this page I want to
mention lastly. Games like Monument Valley are games I talked a lot with my friend about while we brainstormed for new ideas on what to produce next and is also on my to-do list.
