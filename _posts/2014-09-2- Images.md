## The need for responsive images

<p>
Responsive images are very important in today's web, since there is an estimate about more than 18000 different Android devices, which vary in screen size. Providing a user with a high resolution picture that has a width of more than 500px, although the user's device needs a 300px picture maximum and doesn't support a high resolution picture, would be a waste of band width and efficiency. Just as always when talking about graphics, there is a trade off between quality and efficiency.
Setting the image's width to 100% used to be a very premature, but working way to atleast support some quality, losing efficiency though, because images get reseized or their file size might be bigger than needed.

But new responsive image techniques offer a way to support a big variety of devices with qualitively high pictures at a decent efficiency, which take the user's preferences into account and offer a suitable solution for the given bandwidth, because somebody would rather see a picture with a lower quality quicker than having to wait for a high quality picture.
{% highlight html %}
<img alt="dog" src="dog.jpg" srcset="dog-HD.jpg 2x, dog-narrow.jpg 300w, dog-narrow-HD.jpg 600w 2x">  
{% endhighlight %}
The code snippet above shows the srcset attribute that takes the users preferences into account.
