## A Game of Shark and Minnow

<p>
The first thing that I found interesting is the way waypoints have been used to style the document. While scrolling down, opacity of the current and the following image and content block changes in order to achieve a smooth transition between them. Also the background music becomes more silent (or louder) as you approach a new content block. 
The video content is not just displayed directly, rather an image of the first scene of the video is showed till a certain waypoint has been hit and then the video is played. In this way there is an easing in into the video.

Personally, I found the additional visuals very nice, because they added more experience to the plain text. Especially, the maps underlined the content and gave additional information.
In general the webpage is kept rather simple though: There is only two dominant colors white for the background and black for transitions and the fixed top bar, that's always clickable. I always found simple kept webpages more readable and choosing this approach for a newspaper article is advised in my opinion.
In combination with the visuals, the article itself is definitely more interesting to read.
