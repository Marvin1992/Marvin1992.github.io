## The need for responsive images

<p>
Responsive images are very important in today's web, since there is an estimate about more than 18000 different Android devices, which vary in screen size. Providing a user with a high resolution picture that has a width of more than 500px, although the user's device needs a 300px picture maximum and doesn't support a high resolution picture, would be a waste of band width and efficiency. Just as always when talking about graphics, there is a trade off between quality and efficiency.
Setting the image's width to 100% used to be a very premature, but working way to atleast support some quality, losing efficiency though, because images get reseized or their file size might be bigger than needed.

But new responsive image techniques offer a way to support a big variety of devices with qualitively high pictures at a decent efficiency, which take the user's preferences into account and offer a suitable solution for the given bandwidth, because somebody would rather see a picture with a lower quality quicker than having to wait for a high quality picture.
{% highlight html %}
<img alt="dog" src="dog.jpg" srcset="dog-HD.jpg 2x, dog-narrow.jpg 300w, dog-narrow-HD.jpg 600w 2x">  
{% endhighlight %}
The code snippet above shows the srcset attribute that takes the users preferences into account. Since the responsive image issue is still not solved perfectly for the user's needs, a bunch of different beta solutions (scrset or picture) exist. Picturefill 2.0 is a script that allows the developer to use any combination of the these currently offered solutions in order to maximize performance.
In order to use Picturefill you simply have to add the following code lines to your code.
{% highlight html %}
<script>
  document.createElement( "picture" );
</script>

<picture>
  <source srcset="extralarge.jpg, extralarge.jpg 2x" media="(min-width: 1000px)">
  <source srcset="large.jpg, large.jpg 2x" media="(min-width: 800px)">
  <source srcset="medium.jpg">
  <img srcset="medium.jpg" alt="Cambodia Map">
</picture>  

<script src="picturefill.js" async></script>  
{% endhighlight %}
You first have to create the picture element in a script, otherwise your browser will not know what it is and in the end you have to include the picturefill.js file, which is loaded asynchronically, thus is doesn't block the rest of the page from loading.
There are still browser's that will not be able to show the picture, sp Picturefill is a good solution, but still not the ultimate one.
