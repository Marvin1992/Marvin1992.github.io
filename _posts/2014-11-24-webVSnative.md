title: Web vs Native Apps
---

## Which one takes the lead?

<p>
Both web and native apps have their strengths and weaknesses. Which one to choose in terms of development depends on
various factors one has to think about before starting to create the app. <br>
Personally, I would put the amount of time one has for developing the app first. Since developing a native app is more time consuming since one has to develop it for different
platforms, time is very deciding factor. Or one would have to leave certain groups out and concentrate to only develop the
native app for one platform.
</p>
<p>
Number two on the priority list would be the design effort. Having a great user experience can be easier created with native apps.
Of course HTML5 and CSS3 also make it possible to create a good user experience, but it is not as strong yet. </p>
<p>
In the future web apps might be able to take over, because the user needs no update, they are due to their responsive and adaptive
design more flexible with different devices and they are easy to distribute. But for now one still has to think about the ups and downs.
